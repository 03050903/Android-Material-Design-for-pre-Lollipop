# Android-Material-Design-for-pre-Lollipop
Various UI implementations, animations &amp; effects  based on Material Design compatible with pre Lollipop devices as well. (Work in progess)

Implements various Material Design components, that go by the design guidelines. Especially for pre-Lollipop devices.


1. Google+ like screen (Toolbar & FAB animation)  
Demonstrates animation similar to the Google+ app. The toolbar and Floating Action Button (FAB) hide upon scrolling down, and translate back up when scrolled up.

Plus the FAB greets users with a grow animation upon entrance.

The Spinner used on the Toolbar, is a custom implementation.

Option to enable fading for the Toolbar on hide and show. Similar to the effect as seen on the Google I/O 2015 app.

NOTE: I've used my own implementation for a FAB (Check myfab.xml).

2. Transparent Toolbar with Ripple imitation
Transparent and overlayed toolbar. On Lollipop devices, even the status bar is transparent. The FAB on click, shows a custom ripple-like effect for the entire background. It's nothing but a simple circle shape with a grow animation. (Useful for pre-Lollipop).
